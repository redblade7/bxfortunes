# bxfortunes

BitchX Fortunes for Linux provides about 800 fortunes based on kick, quit, and other messages from BitchX, an IRC client popular in the late 90s/early 00s. The Makefile allows you to customize the fortunes, such as your IRC nickname, a kicked user's nickname, and such things as "year of the BitchX" and "official IRC client of the Olympic Games". 

The developer of these fortunes uses Hexchat and has not used BitchX in over a decade. So while the developer is open to adding fortunes from future (or past) versions of BitchX, it is not likely to happen unless someone files a request in the Github Issue Tracker.

All future additions to these files must be compatible with (and will be licensed under) the New BSD License.

Please report any technical problems using the Github Issue Tracker.

These fortunes qualify as "offensive" and are installed as such.
